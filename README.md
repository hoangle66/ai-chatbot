# AI Chatbot Project 🤖

This is a simple AI-powered chatbot built using **TBD** for the final project in CS 4540 (AI Learning). The goal is to create a working chatbot web app that uses AI or language model prompts to provide useful responses.

## 💡 Project Idea
We're building a chatbot that can:
- Answer casual questions
- Recommend games or movies (optional)
- Be easily extendable using AI APIs like OpenAI's GPT models

This project is designed to be completed within a few weeks, focusing on getting a functional and presentable prototype.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (TBD)
- **Python** (Flask)
- **HTML/CSS** (for frontend)
- Optional: OpenAI GPT API (or any LLM)
